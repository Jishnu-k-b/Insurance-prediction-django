# Premium Insurance Prediction

The Premium Insurance Prediction is a straightforward machine learning project implemented in Python. It leverages popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, and joblib to predict insurance expenses based on several key factors. The predictive features include age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, and region.

This project is a practical example of how machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world scenarios, offering a valuable tool for predicting insurance premiums based on relevant personal information. The simplicity of the implementation makes it accessible for users seeking a basic yet effective solution for insurance expense estimation.
